              Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches you is how to <br>
              teach yourself. All you actually do is memorize information in order to regurgitate <br>
              you take the test. You get drilled on how to solve specific exercises so that <br>
              while you know exactly what you need to do when exam time comes around, do you <br>
              truly understand the subject material? All you've really learned is how to pass that <br>
              one test. Once that test is over, the information in your head has outlived its<br>
              usefulness.
